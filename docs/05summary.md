# summary

- people (travellers) operate spaceships.
- spaceships encase travellers, protecting their privacy and mediating their
  identit[ies] and interaction with cypherspace.
- spaceships have bridges/cockpits that people use to operate them.
- spaceships have engines that are used to control and direct the flow of
  information through them from different parts of cypherspace.
- data in cypherspace appears in different galaxies, whose coherence is
  maintained by egalitarian and free programs and protocols.
- orbitals are persistent cryptographically bounded spaces within galaxies that
  spaceships can visit. they may set (and implement) their own policies as they
  choose, according to the respect their residents and visitors pay them.
