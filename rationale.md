## motivation: the ghost of cyberspace

the existing internet's not really space. it's not really a place you can
travel.

"the" internet, the one ruled by ICANN, a host of peering and consumer-facing ISPs  who play
resource games with each other, certificate 

this internet that is talked about these days is a small sliver of all of the
other things the initial decentralised network project is and was, even at that
time. that sliver used to be called the "world wide web". it is no longer
worldwide--it is balkanised and corporatised, it is regulated and stratified,
and its hierarchy is incredibly firm. you know that some things will be hidden
and some will be visible when you v

and that's just it--"the" internet, as it is now, is a collection of
financialised behemoths (not even metaphorically, this is the age of the server
farm) who package up code and content to serve to consumers. sometimes they're
"content creators", but they don't benefit the way an actual "creator"
might. this line was written in 2016 CE and we're still digital sharecropping.

even if you're not a marxist (or a
[telekommunist](http://telekommunisten.net/the-telekommunist-manifesto/)), you
would probably like to own what you create, right? this is literally a world
where people work for scraps (or sometimes for nothing at all) doing things like
[completing menial videogame tasks](http://www.nickyee.com/pubs/Yee%20-%20Labor%20of%20Fun%20(2006).pdf),
write
[articles mainly designed to steal attention](http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/10/twitter-ev-williams-medium-content-fast-food)
(often instead of actually informing),

this kind of network is not much of a space, and certainly not a safe space to
be. if it's any sort of space at all, it's like the railsea of
[china mieville's novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railsea): it approximates
an ocean, but all you can do is switch rails (and companies and governments are
out to put a price tag and patrol on every inch of it).

with the advent of increasingly decentralised, private, independent (in the
sense of capacity) communications, we've been given a chance to revisit the
conception of 'cyberspace' as a separate performative domain.

actually, you know what? scratch the passive voice. here is what happened: a
bunch of really thoughtful people did an unbelievable amount of work for free
and gave it away honestly. that continuing work, in the form of protocol
designs, code, tests, server time, commentary, conversation, and jokes, creates
new spaces the way the internet did before existing social/economic empires and
edifices colonised it.

we've taken to calling it 'cypherspace', since cryptography is one of the main
pillars on which it rests.

cypherspace is a place whose entryways and underpinnings lie outside of
monolithic server farms, name authorities, global singletons, or any other
hierarchy dwarfing any of the people who visit or inhabit it. its limits are
defined solely by the choices of those who work within it, and the consent of
those around them.

while all of this is great news, decentralisation, and the egalitarian agency
that lies beyond it, can't be a purely network layer movement--it needs to
happen at the application layer also. it needs to put people at its center.
